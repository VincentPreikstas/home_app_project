Hi! This is my own personal project dedicated to automating remembering things about maintenance at my house. Basically this is a work in progress calendar/job tracking application with an emphasis on repeated or regularly scheduled jobs and tracking info about them. 

Storage is going to use SQL Server, likely the front end will be a react web application and the back end will likely just be more javascript using nodejs unless during development using something else as the backend seems to be a better option. 

My hope at the end of this project is to deploy it to a server computer at my own house for local network use but also to create the necessary SSIS packages for the database as well as an undecided method for deploying the front end/backend such that the app is portable 
and hopefully somewhat OS agnostic, but we will cross that bridge when we get there, i'm still in a lot of the learning and designing phase.
